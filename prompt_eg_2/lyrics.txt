[verse]
Silent echoes whisper through the midnight air
Your shadow lingers in the spaces we once shared
I traced the cracks in every vow we swore
But this time I’ll rebuild what love is for

[chorus]
Every storm you face, I’ll walk through pouring rain
Every silent battle, I’ll carve hope from the pain
You can’t hide from gravity now
I’ll hold this ground
You feel the pull of destiny now
I’ll hold this ground

[verse]
They claim the fire’s dead, just ashes left to blow
But embers glow where secrets only we know
The world spins faster, but my path’s aligned
To rewrite every wrong we left behind

[chorus]
Every storm you face, I’ll walk through pouring rain
Every silent battle, I’ll carve hope from the pain
You can’t hide from gravity now
I’ll hold this ground
You feel the pull of destiny now
I’ll hold this ground

[bridge]
No, I won’t fade to dust, won’t lose your trust
I’ll climb the walls time couldn’t break
Through every fractured rhyme, we’ll bend the hands of time
And seize the dawn we’ll remake

[outro]
Every storm you face, love’s compass points the way
Every scar we carry lights the path we’ll retrace
You can’t hide from gravity now
I’ll hold this ground
